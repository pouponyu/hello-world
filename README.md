My name is pouponyu. I'm a mechanical engineering student but also want to minor in physics. Hoping for a masters in either aerospace or engineering physics, but that is definitely subject to change. Anyways, I developed (lol) a hobby for coding, and hope to grow more in it through my life. Also dig music performing and recording.
